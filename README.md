------

This is a light-weighted, easy to use and configure image slider library. It's written in html/js/css and uses jquery.   

Requirement: jquery 1.8 or above.   
All the files are in ./js/slider/. See ./js/slider/README.txt.   
Assumption: banner image's width is 1000px. For different width, can adjust parameter in js file.   
slider2.js supports 2 images. slider.js allows to add more images. In general, just use slider.js.   
This does not support IE 8 and lower (disables slide animation for now).   
Tested on Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari, IE 8.
